Collected cells were flash frozen in liquid nitrogen and cryogenically pulverized by mixer milling (Retsch). Pulverized cells were thawed and clarified by centrifugation. Resulting lysates were digested with MNase, quenched with EGTA and resolved by sucrose density gradient ultracentrifugation. Ribosome-protected mRNA footprints were processed as previously described in Becker et al.(2013) Nat Protoc 8(11):2212-2239. Sequencing library was prepared as described in Oh et al.

The frozen cells were pulverized 6 times at 15 Hz for 3 min by a mixer mill (Retsch MM400). The grinding jars were re-chilled in liquid nitrogen to keep the cells frozen between each cycle. After the pulverized cells were recovered, small scoopful was saved for bacterial transcript enrichment. The pulverized cell powder was extracted with acid phenol and chloroform followed by isopropanol precipitation. 16S and 23S ribosomal RNAs were removed by subtractive hybridization using an Epicentre Ribo-Zero Magnetic kit following manufacturer&apos;s manual. The enriched mRNAs were randomly fragmented as described (Oh et al. 2011) The RNA molecules were dephosphorylated by treating with T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs). Then polyacrylamide gel purification was performed for size selection of ~28nt RNA fragments.

Arabinose was added to 0.1% 10 minutes before harvesting the cells to induce the expression of RyhB. Then cells were harvested by pretreatment with chloramphenicol to a final concentration of 100 \u03bcg/ml for 2 minutes followed by rapid filtration by using a 500ml 0.45um PES filter system (Celltreat). Cells were collected and flash frozen in liquid nitrogen together with 0.65 ml lysis buffer (Oh et al. 2011). The frozen cells were pulverized 6 times at 15 Hz for 3 min by a mixer mill (Retsch MM400). The grinding jars were re-chilled in liquid nitrogen to keep the cells frozen between each cycle. After the pulverized cells were recovered, small scoopful was saved for bacterial transcript enrichment. Footprinting and monosome isolation were performed as described (Oh et al. 2011). Briefly, the pulverized cells were thawed. The clarified lysates were treated with micrococcal nuclease (MNase, Worthington Biochemical Corp). Monosomes were isolated by sucrose gradient fractionation. mRNA footprints were purified with acid phenol and chloroform extraction, and isopropanol precipitation. Both ribosomal footprints and total mRNAs were converted into cDNA libraries as described (Ingolia 2010, Oh et al. 2011) with modification.
